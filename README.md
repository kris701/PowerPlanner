# Power Planner

This is a simple little WPF project, made to switch between power plans easily.

This will simply take the power plans that have been made in Windows, and made a slider available to change the power plan fast.
All it takes, is double clicking on the tray icon (the little battery one) and a popup will open.

Also features a little chart, that shows how much the battery level have changed over the last 60 min.
